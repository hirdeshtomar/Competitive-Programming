/*
 * ---Problem Statement---
 * You have to paint N boards of length {A0, A1, A2 â€¦ AN-1}. 
 * There are K painters available and you are also given how much time a painter takes to paint 1 unit of board. 
 * You have to get this job done as soon as possible under the constraints that any painter will only paint
 * continuous sections of board, say board {2, 3, 4} or only board {1} or nothing but not board {2, 4, 5}.
